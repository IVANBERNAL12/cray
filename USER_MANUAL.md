A: Sensor readings every 5 seconds, dashboard refreshes every 60 seconds.

**Q: Is my data secure?**  
A: Yes, data is stored in Supabase with row-level security and encrypted transmission.

**Q: Can I export my data?**  
A: Currently through Supabase dashboard. CSV export feature coming soon.

**Q: What happens if power fails?**  
A: RTC module maintains time. Data resumes logging when power returns.

### Farming Questions

**Q: How long until harvest?**  
A: Typically 4-6 months from juvenile stage to market size (30-50g).

**Q: How many crayfish can I farm?**  
A: Depends on tank size. Recommended: 20-40 adults per square meter.

**Q: What if parameters go out of range?**  
A: System alerts you. Take corrective action: adjust water, aeration, or consult Knowledge Base.

**Q: Can I use tap water?**  
A: Yes, but dechlorinate first. Let stand 24 hours or use water conditioner.

**Q: What's the ideal temperature?**  
A: 22-24¬∞C for optimal growth, 20-25¬∞C is acceptable range.
